# Why We'll Never Go Back to Germany

Not all travel experiences are good ones. Here's the worst one that we've had while traveling overseas.

## What We Took With Us to Frankfurt

* Suitcase
* One pair of pants
* Toothpaste
* One shirt

## The Moral of This Story

_Always remember to bring a spare shirt._
